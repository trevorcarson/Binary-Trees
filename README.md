# Binary-Trees
Full Implementation of a Binary Tree in java:
Files:
- KVpair: "Key-Value" pair, A class representing a key-value pair in a dictionary/symbol table
- SADict: A class for representing a dictionary of key-value pairs. Sort the KVPairs by key in the underlying storage for faster look-up times through bisection search.
- ExpressionTrees: Takes in an expression tree, and eveluates the value of that tree (using basic arithematic operators)
- DictSpeed: Measure the speed of arithmatic operators on a tree. Returns the time required for the computer to operate on the tree.
- BTPrint: This is a helper library for displaying binary trees. Seperate file, because this was more complicated than I anticipated.
- BTNode: A class for representing linked nodes in a Binary Tree. 
- BSTDict: A Dictionary implemented using a Binary Search Tree.
- ADict: A class for representing a dictionary of key-value pairs.
